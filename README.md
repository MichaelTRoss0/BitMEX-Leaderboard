# BitMEX-Leaderboard

This is a web application that takes information from the top 25 traders by Notional at https://www.bitmex.com/app/leaderboard by using the publicly available API. This information is taken and stored everyday in a database, and can then be accessed by going to http://104.248.52.159:8080/, where data can be pulled to compare by date (some dates may not be accessible if you go back too far).
